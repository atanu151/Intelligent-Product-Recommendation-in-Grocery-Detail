# Intelligent-Product-Recommendation-in-Grocery-Detail
All ecommerce websites today focus widely on customer satisfaction and shopping experience; product recommendation plays an important role in generating revenue for ecommerce platforms. Product recommendations is a personalization strategy where products are populated dynamically to a user based on various user attributes which are likely to be purchased by a user. Our project aims at building such an application where we try to predict the likelihood of products to be purchased in a group. For this we have identified data from R datasets package named groceries and have processed the data as per our requirements using PIG. We do our analysis on the processed data using Apriori algorithm and Association rule learning in R and then we have built an interactive shiny application where the data needs to be entered by the user and the application carries out the data analysis on the given data. Once the application is built we put all the packages used by our application in a container and published the same in shinyapps.io platform for use by everyone who intend to use the application.
